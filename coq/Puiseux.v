Lemma zzz : ∀ (psl : list (puiseux_series α)),
  ∃ m, ∀ ps αi mi, ps ∈ psl
  → valuation ps = Some αi → ps_comden ps = mi
    → αi == Qnat mi / Qnat m.
Proof.
intros psl.
remember (val_den_prod psl) as m.
exists m.
intros ps αi mi Hps Hval Hcd.

revert ps αi mi m Hps Hval Hcd Heqm.
induction psl as [| ps₁]; [ contradiction | intros ].
destruct Hps as [Hps| Hps].

Theorem has_neg_slope : ∀ acf pol ns cpol (c : α) r pol₁,
  ns ∈ newton_segments pol
  → cpol = characteristic_polynomial (ac_field acf) pol ns
    → (c, r) = ac_root acf cpol
      → pol₁ = f₁ (ac_field acf) pol (β ns) (γ ns) c
        → ∃ ns₁, ns₁ ∈ newton_segments pol₁ → γ ns₁ > 0.
Proof.
