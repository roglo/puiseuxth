Theorem points_in_any_newton_segment : ∀ pol ns,
  ns ∈ newton_segments fld pol
  → ∀ h αh, (h, αh) ∈ [ini_pt ns; fin_pt ns … oth_pts ns]
    → β ns == αh + h * γ ns.

Theorem points_not_in_any_newton_segment : ∀ pol pts ns,
  pts = points_of_ps_polynom α fld pol
  → ns ∈ newton_segments fld pol
    → ∀ h αh, (h, αh) ∈ pts ∧ (h, αh) ∉ [ini_pt ns; fin_pt ns … oth_pts ns]
      → β ns < αh + h * (γ ns).

Theorem ps_add_comm : ∀ ps₁ ps₂, ps_add ps₁ ps₂ ≈ ps_add ps₂ ps₁.

Theorem ps_add_assoc : ∀ ps₁ ps₂ ps₃,
  ps_add (ps_add ps₁ ps₂) ps₃ ≈ ps_add ps₁ (ps_add ps₂ ps₃).

Theorem ps_add_0_l : ∀ ps, ps_add (ps_zero _) ps ≈ ps.

Theorem ps_add_neg : ∀ ps, ps_add ps (ps_neg ps) ≈ ps_zero _.

Theorem ps_add_compat_r : ∀ ps₁ ps₂ ps₃,
  ps₁ ≈ ps₂ → ps_add ps₁ ps₃ ≈ ps_add ps₂ ps₃.
